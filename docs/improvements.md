## Usage Guidelines

### Using Localization Components
To display text in both English and Arabic:

```tsx
import { LocalizedText } from '../components/ui/localized-text';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LocalizedText 
        en="Hello World" 
        ar="مرحبا بالعالم" 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

For numbers, dates, and currency:

```tsx
import { 
  LocalizedNumber, 
  LocalizedDate, 
  LocalizedCurrency 
} from '../components/ui/localized-text';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LocalizedNumber value={1000} />
      <LocalizedDate value={new Date()} />
      <LocalizedCurrency value={99.99} currency="SAR" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using the Translation Function
For dynamic translations:

```tsx
import { useLanguage } from '../utils/language';

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useLanguage();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('dashboard')}</h1>
      <p>{t('welcomeMessage', { fallback: 'Welcome to our application' })}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Testing Browser Compatibility
To test browser compatibility:

```tsx
import { BrowserCompatibilityTest } from '../components/browser-compatibility-test';

function TestPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Browser Compatibility Test</h1>
      <BrowserCompatibilityTest />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Applying Browser-Specific Fixes
To automatically apply browser-specific fixes:

```tsx
import { BrowserSpecificFixes } from '../components/browser-specific-fixes';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <BrowserSpecificFixes />
      {/* Rest of your application */}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion
These improvements have significantly enhanced the MPBF web application's user experience across different devices, browsers, and languages. The application now provides a consistent experience for both English and Arabic users, with proper responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
